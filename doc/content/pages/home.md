The NIDASH Data Model (NI-DM) is a collection of specification documents that define extensions the the [W3C PROV](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/) standard for the domain of human brain mapping. NI-DM uses provenance information as means to link components from different stages of the scientific research process from dataset descriptors and computational workflow, to derived data and publication.
